        <h5>Pushing to master</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Before pushing you must ensure you tested all resources / features you're about to deploy.</li>
            <li>You must also ensure that you're able to run all - prior and new - tests successfully before pushing.
            </li>
        </ul>
        As long as these preconditions are met, you're free to push to the master branch without review from a group
        member.
        <br>
        We expect merge conflicts to be solved individually, therefore it's important that we push our changes regularly
        so
        conflicts stay at a minimum.
